       <li>Biography</li>
       <p>
          Pablo Picasso was born in Spain in 1881, and was raised there before going on to spend
          most of his adult life working as an artist in France. Throughout the long course of his career,
          he created more than 20,000 paintings, drawings, sculptures, ceramics and other items such as
          costumes and theater sets.

       <p>
          As an artist and an innovator, he is responsible for co-founding the entire Cubist movement alongside
          Georges Braque. Cubism was an avant-garde art movement that changed forever the face of European painting
          and sculpture while simultaneously affecting contemporary architecture, music and literature. Subjects
          and objects in Cubism are broken up into pieces and re-arranged in an abstract form. During the period
          from approximately 1910-1920 when Picasso and Braque were laying the foundation for Cubism in France,
          it's effects were so far-reaching as to inspire offshoots like the styles of Futurism, Dada, and Constructivism
          in other countries.
